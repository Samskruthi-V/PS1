Framework for secure medical record summarization:
The paper explains a decentralized model for storing electronic medical prescriptions and records using blockchain technology, InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), 
and Ethereum with decentralized applications. The goal here is to protect sensitive patient data and provide easy access to medical data when needed. 
This framework uses AI techniques, like optical character recognition (OCR) and machine learning, to process and summarize the stored medical records into a 
patient's history report. This report contains essential information and is securely stored on a decentralized blockchain. But challenges of time constraints and 
incomplete medical history for doctors must be addressed to improve healthcare provisions. 5G network is integrated into the framework for fast and reliable
communication. The proposed system model involves creating a distributed network on Ethereum, uploading medical records to IPFS with Ethereum smart contracts,
extracting information using OCR and machine learning, and generating a comprehensive summary. People accessing this report include doctors, patients and other 
authorized stakeholders. The framework adds value to the EMR system by improving efficiency and accessibility while ensuring data security. 
The system uses the IPFS python library to connect to an IPFS Peer via Infura. The documents are retrieved using their hash. Image preprocessing happens and 
is sent to the Tesseract OCR engine for text extraction. Preprocessing includes rescaling, removing shadows, noise reduction etc. For handwritten prescriptions,
the system uses Microsoft Azure Computer Vision API.
Three sub-utilities are used in the system. Sub-utility 1 is for extracting data from printed prescriptions using OCR, two extracts abnormal values and 
corresponding test names from reports using the Pythondocx package and three extracts data from handwritten prescriptions using Microsoft Azure.
The IPFS hashes are stored on the blockchain to reduce costs. The execution time for accessing media from IPFS increases with the number of peers and the 
size of the image or report. Cost considerations are a primary factor in choosing cloud platforms for OCR; that's why Microsoft Azure is selected with its 
least projected costs among all other choices. The accuracy achieved differed based on different document types, with the best accuracy observed with Type 1 
documents. Preprocessing the images resulted in an overall improvement in character recognition accuracy. The model generates summary reports that provide 
concise information for healthcare professionals, reducing the time required for analysis.
