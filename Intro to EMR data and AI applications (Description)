Intro to EMR data and AI applications:
The article starts by providing details about the importance of big data and artificial intelligence (AI). We see that hospitals are adopting AI to improve 
operational efficiency and patient management using EMR (Electronic Medical Record) data. EMR data includes a patient's health history and other information, 
which can be used for various purposes like creating personalized medicine and new drug development. But we should be aware that, to improve the performance of 
AI research using EMR data, we must ensure proper data standardization, refinement, and quality management. We should also be aware that protecting patient 
privacy is vital due to the sensitive nature of EMR data. Governments like the United States and Korean governments are supporting various initiatives and 
implementing them to promote the use of EMR data for research and encourage researchers to be more proactive. The article continued to discuss the different 
types of medical data in EMR, which are structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, and it highlighted the applications and examples of AI research using 
EMR data, particularly in cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. It concluded by mentioning the policies and considerations to be considered when researching 
EMR data, emphasizing the need for collaboration between medical and analysis domains and appropriate data preprocessing techniques.
